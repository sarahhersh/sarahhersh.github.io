  <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Sun-dried tomato tapenade. This wonderful recipe is what everyone should have in their repertoire for appetizers. Ready in less than 10 minutes, if you have any leftovers, they can last in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.

        A perfect balance of basil and sun-dried tomatoes. The anchovies play a very important role in this dish as they give it the necessary saltiness and savor. As you may notice while reading the recipe, that no salt is added.
        
        Served alongside fresh slices of baguette or crackers. Try it also over mozzarella for a spin to your Caprese salad.</p>

     <ul>

        <li>1 minced garlic clove</li>
        <li>about 1/2 cup packed fresh basil leaves</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>  
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparations</h2>
    <ol> 
        <li>Place all ingredients in a food processor and chop. Add olive oil until you get a smoother texture. Serve with crackers or slices of toasted baguette.</li>
      
        <li>I serve it in a "weck" pot like the ones you buy to put the mousse de foie gras in. It is a rustic presentation.</li>
