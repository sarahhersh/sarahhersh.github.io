                <p>With the rise of TikTok, beauty trends and standards have been swirling the internet. The clothes our
                    parents wore in their teens are now staples in many peoples wardrobes, and what seemed trendy a few
                    months ago is out. Social media has created a space that encourages and rewards individuality,
                    therefore the rise of micro trends is here. Our society no longer bends to one ultimate trend to
                    follow, individuals are finding their own niche style to go by.
                </p>

                <p>The newest trends being shown on the platform and others like it are “costal grandmother”, Y2K, the
                    clean girl makeup no makeup look, skin cycling, and so much more.
                </p>

                <p>While people are constantly trying to incorporate new looks into their wardrobe and have the hottest,
                    more up to date clothes, they fail to realize that many of the pieces can be found in their parents
                    closet. </p>

                <p>Lets take a look at the “costal grandma” trend. The basis of achieving this look is straight leg
                    jeans or casual dress pant, accompanied by a basic tee shirt and a cardigan. The shoes that usually
                    accompany this look are a pair of lowtop Reebok Tennis sneakers, loafers, and sometimes platform ugg
                    slippers.

                <p><b>If you sit down with your parents yearbooks and pictures from the ‘70s and ‘80s you will find them
                        rocking a majority of these staples. Without a doubt, every parent whether it is your mom or
                        dad owned or still owns a pair of straight leg 501 Levi Jeans. Even take a look into your grandma's closet. She will have the best staple jeans, loafers, sweaters, ect.

                <p>According to the Reebok website, the infamous tennis sneakers everyone has been rocking were first
                    created in the 1980’s and they were “responsible for 7.7% of total tennis footwear sales in the U.S.
                    that year,” and that number continued to grow each year.
                </p>

                <p>Another trend that has been spiraling the internet is Y2K. The major influences people looked to for
                    inspiration are people like Paris Hilton, Britney Spears, and Christina Aguilera.
                </p>
                <p>Brands that were popular in the early 2000s like Deisel, Ed Hardy, and Ugg are here to stay by
                    remodeling themselves to adapt to newer trends while sticking to their roots.

                <p> When men say that like when girls look natural, what they really mean is they like when girls spend
                    and hour on their makeup to look like they are not wearing makeup. Lucky for them, the exaggerated
                    smokey eyes that were very popular in 2015 are out and “the clean girl trend” is in.
                </p>


                <p>People everywhere are prioritizing their skincare to get glowy, even looking skin. The use of tinted
                    sunscreen and and cream products are the go to. Tarte, the famous makeup brand, has recently made
                    blush and lipgloss that changes to the PH of your skin tone. Even sunscreen brands are selling
                    makeup. Makeup conosores are spending copious amounts of money and time to make their faces look
                    sunkissed and fresh faced while appearing to wear no makeup at all.
